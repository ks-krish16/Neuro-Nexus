# 🧠 Neuro Nexus – Portable EEG Monitoring System



---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

India faces a dual crisis in neurological healthcare:

1. **Inaccessibility of Neurological Diagnostics**
   - EEG and MRI machines are concentrated in Tier 1 cities.
   - Patients in rural or semi-urban areas face fatal delays during time-sensitive emergencies like strokes or seizures — missing the “golden hour.”

2. **Epidemic of Cognitive Stress**
   - Academic and corporate pressures have led to chronic stress, anxiety, and burnout.
   - There are no affordable tools to measure and manage cognitive load in real-time.
